# Automatic Series Tracker
- Rewritten into TypeScript

This allows you to watch your favorite series on VLC and automatically synchronize series with [Series-Tracker](https://github.com/JakubSladek/series-tracker).

## How does that work? ü§î

- App listens to VLC port and triggers an event on status change, then checks if it has season and episode.
- If its recognized as a series(have season and episode in meta or in title/filename) will be processed and then App will fetch all your series from site through WP-Rest API.
- Then it checks if the name of series that's got from VLC exists on Website and if there's a difference between season and/or episodes, then app will send an update request to WP-Rest API, if the series doesn't already exist in Rest, then app will try to create a new series post.
